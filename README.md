## Unit 19 Homework: Cryptocurrency Wallet

### Background

In this assignemnt we work at a startup that is building a new and disruptive platform called KryptoJobs2Go. KryptoJobs2Go is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. As KryptoJobs2Goâ€™s lead developer, we have been tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable your customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.

In this Challenge, we will complete the code that enables your customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals. To develop the code and test it out, we will assume the perspective of a KryptoJobs2Go customer who is using the application to find a fintech professional and pay them for their work.
